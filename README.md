## About PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is a powerful,
open-source relational database management system known for its robust features and scalability.
It is widely used for a variety of applications and is known for its reliability and extensibility.

Learn more about PostgreSQL [here](https://www.postgresql.org/).

## Docker Image Overview

Our Docker image is based on the official PostgreSQL Docker image, with the addition of various tools and configurations. Here's what you'll find in this image:

- **Base Image**: [PostgreSQL 16.0](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres)
   - This image provides a PostgreSQL database server, configured to be used as a standalone database instance.

- **Volume Mounts**: This image sets up volume mounts for `/etc/postgresql`, `/var/log/postgresql`, and `/var/lib/postgresql`. These volumes allow you to persist configuration, logs, and database data, ensuring data integrity and easy management.

- **Custom Initialization Script**: The image includes an `init.sql` script placed in `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/`. This script will be executed during the database initialization, allowing you to perform custom setup tasks.

- **Additional Packages**: The image installs several additional packages, including `libmagic1`, `restic`, `ssh-client`, `python3-pip`, `pipx`, `python3-dev`, and `postgresql-plpython3-16`, expanding the image's capabilities.

- **Locale Configuration**: Locale settings are configured to ensure correct character encoding.

- **Python Libraries**: Python libraries such as `rsa` and `python-magic` are installed to provide additional functionality for PostgreSQL extensions or custom scripts.

## Prerequisites

Before using this Docker image, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/): Install Docker to build and run containers.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git): Install Git to clone this repository and access Dockerfiles.

## Getting Started

To get started with our PostgreSQL Docker image, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/orion6dev/pg-german.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

   ```bash
   cd pg-german
   ```

3. Build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile:

   ```bash
   docker build -t my-postgresql-app .
   ```

4. Run a container from the image:

   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 5432:5432 --name my-postgresql-container my-postgresql-app
   ```

Now, your PostgreSQL database server should be accessible at `localhost:5432`.

## Usage Examples

Here are a few examples of how you can use our PostgreSQL Docker image:

### Example 1: Custom Initialization Script

You can use the `init.sql` script to perform custom setup tasks during database initialization. Place your SQL commands in this script.

### Example 2: Installing PostgreSQL Extensions

You can extend PostgreSQL by installing extensions using `CREATE EXTENSION` commands within your SQL scripts.

### Example 3: Running Python Scripts

With Python libraries like `python-magic` installed, you can run custom Python scripts within your PostgreSQL environment.

For example:

```sql
create or replace language "plpython3u"; 

create or replace function mimemagic(data bytea) returns text as
$$
import magic
return magic.from_buffer(data, mime=True)
$$ language plpython3u;

create or replace function compress(data bytea) returns bytea as
$$
import zlib
return zlib.compress(data)
$$ language plpython3u;

create or replace function decompress(data bytea) returns bytea as
$$
import zlib
return zlib.decompress(data)
$$ languageÂ plpython3u;
```
