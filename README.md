## About PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is a powerful,
open-source relational database management system known for its robust features and scalability.
It is widely used for a variety of applications and is known for its reliability and extensibility.

Learn more about PostgreSQL [here](https://www.postgresql.org/).

## Docker Image Overview

Our Docker image is based on the official PostgreSQL Docker image, with the addition of various tools and configurations. Here's what you'll find in this image:

- **Base Image**: [PostgreSQL 16.0](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres)
   - This image provides a PostgreSQL database server, configured to be used as a standalone database instance.

- **Volume Mounts**: This image sets up volume mounts for `/etc/postgresql`, `/var/log/postgresql`, and `/var/lib/postgresql`. These volumes allow you to persist configuration, logs, and database data, ensuring data integrity and easy management.

- **Custom Initialization Script**: The image includes an `init.sql` script placed in `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/`. This script will be executed during the database initialization, allowing you to perform custom setup tasks.

- **Additional Packages**: The image installs several additional packages, including `libmagic1`, `restic`, `ssh-client`, `python3-pip`, `pipx`, `python3-dev`, and `postgresql-plpython3-16`, expanding the image's capabilities.

- **Locale Configuration**: Locale settings are configured to ensure correct character encoding.

- **Python Libraries**: Python libraries such as `rsa` and `python-magic` are installed to provide additional functionality for PostgreSQL extensions or custom scripts.

## Prerequisites

Before using this Docker image, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/): Install Docker to build and run containers.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git): Install Git to clone this repository and access Dockerfiles.

## Getting Started

To get started with our PostgreSQL Docker image, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/orion6dev/pg-german.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

   ```bash
   cd pg-german
   ```

3. Build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile:

   ```bash
   docker build -t my-postgresql-app .
   ```

4. Run a container from the image:

   ```bash
   docker run --rm -d -p 5432:5432 --name my-postgresql-app ghcr.io/orion6dev/pg-german:dev
   ```
   docker pull ghcr.io/orion6dev/pg-german:dev

```bash
docker compose -f support/docker-compose-db.yml up
```


Now, your PostgreSQL database server should be accessible at `localhost:5432`.

## Usage Examples

Here are a few examples of how you can use our PostgreSQL Docker image:

### Example 1: Custom Initialization Script

You can use the `init.sql` script to perform custom setup tasks during database initialization. Place your SQL commands in this script.

### Example 2: Installing PostgreSQL Extensions

You can extend PostgreSQL by installing extensions using `CREATE EXTENSION` commands within your SQL scripts.

### Example 3: Running Python Scripts

With Python libraries like `python-magic` installed, you can run custom Python scripts within your PostgreSQL environment.

For example:

```sql
create or replace language "plpython3u"; 

create or replace function mimemagic(data bytea) returns text as
$$
import magic
return magic.from_buffer(data, mime=True)
$$ language plpython3u;

create or replace function compress(data bytea) returns bytea as
$$
import zlib
return zlib.compress(data)
$$ language plpython3u;

create or replace function decompress(data bytea) returns bytea as
$$
import zlib
return zlib.decompress(data)
$$ languageÂ plpython3u;
```

# Custom PostgreSQL Docker Image with SSH and pgBackRest

This repository provides a custom Docker image for PostgreSQL with SSH and pgBackRest configured for easy backup and restore operations. The image also includes additional utilities such as `libmagic`, `restic`, and Python packages.

## Table of Contents

- [Features](#features)
- [Building the Image](#building-the-image)
- [Running the Container](#running-the-container)
- [Configuring SSH Keys](#configuring-ssh-keys)
- [Custom Configuration](#custom-configuration)
- [Using pgBackRest](#using-pgbackrest)
- [Sample Commands](#sample-commands)

## Features

- PostgreSQL 16.3
- SSH server for secure remote access
- pgBackRest for reliable backup and restore
- Additional utilities: `libmagic`, `restic`, `python3-pip`, `pipx`, `python3-dev`, `postgresql-plpython3-16`
- Customizable PostgreSQL configuration

## Building the Image

To build the Docker image, clone this repository and run the following command:

```sh
docker build -t orion6/orion6dev.postgres .
```

## Running the Container

To run the container, use the following command. Ensure you have the necessary files (`id_rsa.pub`, `init.sql`, and `postgresql.conf`) in the specified paths on your host machine:

```sh
docker run -d --name my-postgres-container \
  -v /path/to/ssh-keys/id_rsa.pub:/var/lib/postgresql/.ssh/authorized_keys \
  -v /path/to/init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql \
  -v /path/to/config/postgresql.conf:/etc/postgresql.conf \
  -p 5432:5432 -p 2222:22 orion6/orion6dev.postgres
```

### Parameters:
- `/path/to/ssh-keys/id_rsa.pub`: Path to your SSH public key on the host.
- `/path/to/init.sql`: Path to your SQL initialization script.
- `/path/to/config/postgresql.conf`: Path to your custom PostgreSQL configuration file.
- `-p 5432:5432`: Maps the PostgreSQL port.
- `-p 2222:22`: Maps the SSH port.

## Configuring SSH Keys

Ensure you have an SSH key pair on your backup host. Copy the public key to the host directory that you will mount into the container.

```sh
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "pgbackrest@backuphost"
```

Copy the public key to the directory you will mount:

```sh
cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub /path/to/ssh-keys/
```

## Custom Configuration

Your custom PostgreSQL configuration file should be placed in the directory you will mount to the container. For example, create a `postgresql.conf` file with your desired settings and place it in `/path/to/config/`.

## Using pgBackRest

pgBackRest is included in the image for backup and restore operations. Ensure your `pgbackrest.conf` is properly configured and accessible.

### Example `pgbackrest.conf`:

```ini
[main-db]
pg1-path=/var/lib/postgresql/data
pg1-port=5432
repo1-path=/var/lib/pgbackrest
repo1-retention-full=2

[global]
repo1-cipher-pass=<encryption_passphrase>
repo1-cipher-type=aes-256-cbc

[global:archive-push]
compress-level=3
```

Place this configuration file in a suitable location, accessible to your pgBackRest commands.

## Sample Commands

### Running a Backup

To perform a backup, execute the following command from your pgBackRest host:

```sh
pgbackrest --stanza=main-db backup
```

### Restoring a Backup

To restore a backup, use:

```sh
pgbackrest --stanza=main-db restore
```

### Checking Backup Status

To check the status of your backups, run:

```sh
pgbackrest --stanza=main-db check
```

## Monitoring and Logs

You can view logs for PostgreSQL and pgBackRest within the container to monitor the status of your database and backup operations.

### Accessing PostgreSQL Logs

To view PostgreSQL logs, you can attach to the running container or use Docker logs:

```sh
docker logs my-postgres-container
```

### Accessing SSH

To access the container via SSH:

```sh
ssh -i /path/to/private/key -p 2222 postgres@<container-host-ip>
```

Ensure you replace `<container-host-ip>` with the actual IP address of the host running the container.

## Conclusion

This custom PostgreSQL Docker image provides a robust environment with SSH and pgBackRest for secure and reliable database operations. Customize the configuration as needed and use the provided commands to manage your PostgreSQL instance efficiently.

For further details and best practices, refer to the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/) and [pgBackRest user guide](https://pgbackrest.org/user-guide.html).
