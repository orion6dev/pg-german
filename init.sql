   Transaction Isolation Level Documentation

   The SQL statement 'START TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;' initiates a
   new database transaction with the isolation level set to "SERIALIZABLE." This
   transaction isolation level is the highest level of isolation and offers the
   strictest guarantees for data consistency and integrity.

   Key Points:
   - Serializable Isolation: The "SERIALIZABLE" isolation level ensures that
     transactions are executed in a manner that guarantees serializability. This
     means that concurrent transactions will not produce results that could not have
     been achieved by running them sequentially.
   - Locking Mechanisms: To achieve serializability, the database system may
     utilize various locking mechanisms to prevent concurrent transactions from
     accessing the same data simultaneously.
   - Data Integrity: "SERIALIZABLE" isolation provides a high level of data integrity,
     making it suitable for scenarios where maintaining strict data consistency is
     critical.

   Usage:
   - This isolation level is typically chosen when there is a need to prevent
     anomalies like dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads in a
     high-concurrency environment.
   - It ensures that transactions are executed in a manner that preserves the
     consistency of data, even in the presence of concurrent access.

   Caution:
   - Using "SERIALIZABLE" isolation may impact performance, as it can lead to
     increased contention and potential blocking of concurrent transactions.

   Example:
   - Starting a new transaction with "SERIALIZABLE" isolation:
     START TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;

   It's important to consider the specific requirements of your application and
   the potential performance implications when choosing this isolation level.

   Database Extensions Creation Documentation

   The following SQL statements are used to create database extensions if they do
   not already exist. Database extensions are additional features or functions
   that can be added to a PostgreSQL database to enhance its capabilities.

   Extensions Created:
   1. ltree: The "ltree" extension provides support for hierarchical or tree-like
      structures, allowing you to work with tree data within the database.
   2. pgcrypto: The "pgcrypto" extension provides cryptographic functions and
      utilities for secure data storage and retrieval.
   3. hstore: The "hstore" extension adds support for the "hstore" data type, which
      is a key-value store within a PostgreSQL database.
   4. "uuid-ossp": The "uuid-ossp" extension enables the generation of universally
      unique identifiers (UUIDs) based on the OSSP UUID library.

   Usage:
   - These extensions can be useful for various database operations, including
     working with hierarchical data, securing sensitive information, managing
     key-value data, and generating UUIDs.

   Caution:
   - Ensure that you have the necessary privileges to create extensions in the
     database.
   - Be cautious when enabling extensions, as they may impact the behavior and
     performance of your database.

   Example:
   - Creating extensions if they do not already exist:
     CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS ltree;
     CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgcrypto;
     CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS hstore;
     CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";

   It's important to evaluate your specific database requirements and only enable
   extensions that are relevant to your application's needs.

   Table Documentation for 'rt_string_vault'

   The 'rt_string_vault' table is designed to serve as a centralized repository for
   storing strings with deduplication. It provides a mechanism to efficiently store
   and manage unique string values while associating them with a timestamp.

   Table Columns:
   - 'id' (serial primary key): An auto-incremented unique identifier for each record
     in the table. This column serves as the primary key.
   - 'value' (text): The actual string value to be stored in the vault. This column
     is used to store the unique string values.
   - 'created_on' (timestamp without time zone): A timestamp that indicates when the
     string value was added to the vault. It is set to the current timestamp in UTC
     by default.

   Usage:
   - The 'rt_string_vault' table is useful in scenarios where there is a need to
     maintain a repository of unique string values to prevent duplication and
     efficiently manage string data.
   - Strings can be added to the vault using INSERT statements, and the system
     will automatically ensure that only unique values are stored.
   - The 'created_on' timestamp provides information about when each string value
     was added to the vault.

   Example:
   - To insert a unique string value into the 'rt_string_vault' table:
     INSERT INTO rt_string_vault (value) VALUES ('Unique String Value');

   This table facilitates the efficient storage and retrieval of unique string
   values while maintaining a record of their creation timestamps.

   Function: rt_appendstring

   Description:
   This PostgreSQL function, named 'rt_appendstring', is designed to add string
   values to a table called 'rt_string_vault' with deduplication. It takes a single
   input parameter of type 'text' and returns an integer ('int4').

   Function Signature:
   - Parameters:
     - $1 (Input, text): The string value to be added to the 'rt_string_vault' table.

   Function Behavior:
   - If the input string ($1) is null, the function returns 1 without performing any
     further actions.
   - If the input string ($1) is not null, the function checks if a record with the
     same 'value' exists in the 'rt_string_vault' table.
     - If a matching record is found, the function retrieves the 'id' (integer) of
       the existing record into the 'key' variable.
     - If no matching record is found, the function inserts the input string ($1)
       into the 'rt_string_vault' table, and it returns the newly generated serial
       'id' for the inserted record using 'currval'.
   - In both cases, the function returns an integer ('int4') representing either the
     'id' of the existing record or the 'id' of the newly inserted record.

   Example Usage:
   - To add a string to the 'rt_string_vault' table and retrieve its associated 'id':
     SELECT rt_appendstring('Sample String');

   Caution:
   - Ensure that the 'rt_string_vault' table exists with the required schema before
     using this function.
   - The function performs deduplication by checking for existing string values in
     the table and does not insert duplicate strings.

   Note:
   - This function is designed for scenarios where you want to maintain a unique set
     of string values with associated identifiers, useful for optimizing storage
     and retrieval of string data.

   Function Definition:
   - The function is implemented in PL/pgSQL language and uses conditional logic to
     manage the insertion and retrieval of string values in the 'rt_string_vault'
     table.

   Table: rt_key_value

   Description:
   The 'rt_key_value' table is designed to store key-value pairs, where 'key_id' and
   'value_id' are integers ('int4'). This table allows you to establish relationships
   between keys and corresponding values.

   Table Structure:
   - 'key_id' (Primary Key, int4): This column represents the key in the key-value
     pair. It serves as the primary identifier for a specific key-value relationship.
     It must be unique within the table.

   - 'value_id' (int4): This column represents the associated value for the key. It
     stores the identifier of the corresponding value in the key-value relationship.

   Usage and Purpose:
   - The 'rt_key_value' table is commonly used to create flexible relationships
     between entities in a database. Each 'key_id' is associated with a specific
     'value_id', allowing you to represent various associations, mappings, or
     configurations in your database.

   Example Usage:
   - You can use this table to create associations between various entities. For
     instance, you might use it to associate a product 'key_id' with its respective
     category 'value_id' in an e-commerce system.

   Constraints:
   - 'key_id' is defined as the primary key of the table, ensuring that each key is
     unique within the table.

   Important Notes:
   - Ensure that you manage and maintain the integrity of the data in this table,
     especially when establishing relationships between keys and values.

   Table Definition:
   - The 'rt_key_value' table consists of two columns, 'key_id' and 'value_id', both
     of which are of integer type ('int4').
   - 'key_id' serves as the primary key for the table.

   Example Creation:
   - To create the 'rt_key_value' table, you can use the following SQL statement:
     CREATE TABLE rt_key_value (
         key_id   int4 PRIMARY KEY,
         value_id int4
     );

   Caution:
   - Ensure that 'key_id' values remain unique to maintain the integrity of the
     relationships stored in this table.

   Sequences: business_key_seq and row_id_seq

   Description:
   Sequences 'business_key_seq' and 'row_id_seq' are used to generate unique integer
   values that serve as keys for identifying records in specific tables. These
   sequences are typically employed as primary key values in tables where they ensure
   the uniqueness and integrity of records.

   'business_key_seq' Sequence:
   - 'business_key_seq' is designed to generate unique business keys, which are
     used as identifiers for business entities. These keys are essential for ensuring
     that each entity in the database has a distinct identifier.

   'row_id_seq' Sequence:
   - 'row_id_seq' is used to generate unique row identifiers. These identifiers are
     often employed in bi-temporal databases to distinguish different versions or
     states of an entity over time. They serve as temporal identifiers within the
     bi-temporal framework.

   Sequence Creation:
   - These sequences can be created using the following SQL statements:
     CREATE SEQUENCE business_key_seq;
     CREATE SEQUENCE row_id_seq;

   Usage and Purpose:
   - 'business_key_seq' is typically used to generate primary key values for tables
     that represent business entities or records.
   - 'row_id_seq' is commonly utilized in tables where temporal tracking of entities
     is required, allowing differentiation between different versions of the same
     entity.

   Important Notes:
   - Ensure that the sequences are correctly initialized and configured before using
     them as primary key generators in tables.
   - Sequences should be used consistently to maintain data integrity and uniqueness.

   Example Usage:
   - After creating these sequences, you can use them in INSERT statements to
     generate unique primary key values for specific tables. For example:
     INSERT INTO some_table (id, column1, column2)
     VALUES (nextval('business_key_seq'), 'Value1', 'Value2');

/*
   DDL Documentation for bi_temporal_base_table

   This table, 'bi_temporal_base_table', is designed to support bi-temporal data
   management, which tracks time validity, decision time, and database transaction
   time for records. 

   Column Definitions:
   - 'id': A unique identifier for each record in the table. It is of BIGINT data
     type and is automatically generated using the 'business_key_seq' sequence.
   - 'row_id': A unique identifier for each row in the table, also automatically
     generated using the 'row_id_seq' sequence.
   - 'valid_time': Represents the time range during which the record is considered
     valid. It uses the 'TSTZRANGE' data type and has a default value that starts
     from the current time in UTC and extends to infinity.
   - 'decision_time': Indicates the time range during which a decision was made
     regarding the record. It uses the 'TSTZRANGE' data type and has a default
     value starting from the current time in UTC and extending to infinity.
   - 'db_tx_time': Represents the time range during which the record was modified
     as part of a database transaction. It also uses the 'TSTZRANGE' data type and
     has a default value starting from the current time in UTC and extending to
     infinity.

   Primary Key:
   - The primary key of this table consists of two columns: 'id' and 'row_id'. This
     ensures each record is uniquely identified within the table.

   This table serves as a base for bi-temporal data management and will likely be
   extended by other tables to capture specific data domains.

   The 'id' and 'row_id' combination in this table serves a crucial role in
   pointing to an entity in time. While 'id' alone identifies a unique entity
   that evolves over time, 'row_id' further distinguishes different versions
   or states of that entity. Together, they form a composite primary key that
   allows us to track changes and variations of the same entity over time. 'id'
   represents a persistent identifier for the entity, ensuring that we can
   refer to the same entity across different temporal states. On the other hand,
   'row_id' serves as a temporal identifier, indicating the specific version or
   snapshot of the entity within the bi-temporal framework. This combination
   enables precise temporal querying and tracking of historical and current
   states of entities in the database.   
*/

/*
   Developer's Documentation for 'row_id'

   In our database model, the 'row_id' serves as a pivotal attribute with a
   database-wide sequence generating a unique ID for every row. This attribute
   plays a fundamental role in ensuring data integrity and facilitating
   temporal data management.

   The uniqueness of 'row_id' guarantees that each row within the database is
   distinguishable, providing an unambiguous identifier for individual records.
   Consequently, it becomes an invaluable tool for tracking the temporal aspects
   of data changes.

   One of the key characteristics of 'row_id' is its association with the 'id'
   attribute within a transaction. In practice, the highest 'row_id' for a given
   'id' represents the newest entry or the most recent state of that entity within
   the context of the transaction.

   This behavior allows for efficient retrieval of the latest entry for a specific
   entity. By selecting an entity by 'id' ordered by 'row_id' in descending order
   and limiting the result to 1, developers can consistently obtain the most
   recent version or snapshot of that entity within the scope of a transaction.

   Example Query:
   SELECT *
   FROM bi_temporal_base_table
   WHERE id = 'your_entity_id'
   ORDER BY row_id DESC
   LIMIT 1;

   In this query, substituting 'your_entity_id' with the desired entity identifier
   will reliably retrieve the latest entry for that entity within the current
   transaction.

   The 'row_id' attribute, in conjunction with 'id,' facilitates precise temporal
   querying and tracking of historical and current states of entities in the
   database, making it an integral part of our bi-temporal data management strategy.
*/

/*
   Developer's Documentation for 'db_tx_time'

   The 'db_tx_time' column in this table plays a crucial role in enabling time travel
   within the database. It represents a closed-open interval that records the time
   range during which a particular row or entity was modified as part of a database
   transaction. The interval is expressed in the 'TSTZRANGE' data type, ensuring
   precise temporal tracking.

   How 'db_tx_time' is Used:
   - To Time Travel: When performing a time travel query, the 'db_tx_time' column is
     queried to find rows where the 'QueryTxTime' falls within the interval. This
     effectively retrieves the state of an entity at a specific point in time defined
     by 'QueryTxTime'. If there is a row for a given 'id' where 'QueryTxTime' is
     inside the 'db_tx_time' interval, it indicates that the entity with that 'id'
     exists at that particular time.

   Entity Existence Determination:
   - If there is no row in the table for a given 'id' where 'QueryTxTime' falls
     inside the 'db_tx_time' interval, it implies that the entity identified by the
     'id' does not exist at that precise point in time. This mechanism provides a
     powerful means to verify the existence of entities throughout the database's
     temporal history.

   'db_tx_time' thus facilitates accurate time-based querying and ensures that the
   database can be effectively navigated to examine entity states at different
   moments in its history.
*/

/*
   Developer's Documentation for 'valid_time'

   The 'valid_time' column within the 'bi_temporal_base_table' is a pivotal component
   of the bi-temporal data management framework. It represents a time range during
   which a specific record is considered valid. This temporal validity concept is
   particularly valuable for scenarios where historical and current states of data
   need to be tracked and queried.

   For example, consider a scenario in which the 'bi_temporal_base_table' contains
   records representing product prices over time. The 'valid_time' column for each
   record specifies the period during which that price was valid. If a user wants to
   retrieve the price of a product as it stood on a particular date, they can use
   'valid_time' to filter the records to find the one with a 'valid_time' interval
   containing the desired date.

   Example Query:
   SELECT price
   FROM bi_temporal_base_table
   WHERE product_id = '123'
   AND '2023-06-15'::timestamptz <@ valid_time;

   In this example, the 'valid_time' column assists in retrieving the correct price
   for the product on June 15, 2023, even if the price has changed multiple times in
   the past.

   The 'valid_time' column thus empowers developers to perform precise temporal
   queries and navigate through historical data with ease, making it a valuable
   tool in bi-temporal data management.
*/

/*
   Developer's Documentation for 'decision_time'

   The 'decision_time' column within the 'bi_temporal_base_table' is a crucial
   element in bi-temporal data management, representing the time range during which
   decisions or changes were made regarding a specific record. This temporal
   attribute is particularly valuable when tracking and understanding the context
   of changes to data.

   For instance, consider a scenario where the 'bi_temporal_base_table' contains
   records for employee promotions within a company. In this context, 'decision_time'
   would denote the period during which the promotion decision was made. If an HR
   analyst wishes to identify all employees who received promotions during a specific
   quarter, they can utilize 'decision_time' to filter records based on this timeframe.

   Example Query:
   SELECT employee_name
   FROM bi_temporal_base_table
   WHERE promotion_status = 'Promoted'
   AND '2023-Q2'::tstzrange @> decision_time;

   In this example, 'decision_time' assists in isolating the promotion decisions
   made during the second quarter of 2023.

   The 'decision_time' column is a valuable tool for developers to comprehend and
   analyze changes within the temporal context of their data. It enables precise
   querying of records affected by specific decisions or events, enhancing the
   utility of bi-temporal data management.
*/

/*
   Developer's Documentation for Interaction between 'valid_time' and 'decision_time'

   The 'valid_time' and 'decision_time' columns within the 'bi_temporal_base_table'
   collectively facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the temporal aspects of
   data changes and decisions. The interaction between these columns is instrumental
   in scenarios where it is essential to discern not only when a record is valid but
   also when decisions were made that influenced its validity.

   Consider a scenario where the 'bi_temporal_base_table' contains records for
   contract agreements. 'valid_time' represents the period during which a contract
   is considered valid, while 'decision_time' indicates when a decision or change
   was made regarding that contract. By examining both attributes together, users can
   derive valuable insights. For instance, to identify contracts that were extended
   during a specific month and understand when those extensions were decided, one
   can use a query like this:

   Example Query:
   SELECT contract_id, valid_time, decision_time
   FROM bi_temporal_base_table
   WHERE contract_status = 'Extended'
   AND '2023-05-01'::timestamptz <@ valid_time
   AND '2023-05-01'::timestamptz <@ decision_time;

   In this example, the query extracts contracts that were extended in May 2023 and
   provides the 'valid_time' (the period of validity) and 'decision_time' (the time
   the extension decision was made) for each of those contracts.

   The interplay between 'valid_time' and 'decision_time' empowers developers to
   explore the temporal dimensions of data, enabling precise queries that reveal not
   only the current state but also the historical decision-making context. It is a
   powerful feature for comprehensive bi-temporal data management.
